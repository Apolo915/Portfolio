    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <img src="MyPhoto.png" alt="me" style="float:right;width:400px;height:400px;">
    <pre id="intro">
    My name is Arturo Matson, I'm a game programming student and this website will be used as a portfolio. I'm 22 years old and I'm from Colombia.
    I moved to canada 4 months ago to follow my dreams. I've been playing videogames my whole life and I think it's my favorite hobby. When i was
    younger I didn't think about the possibility of studying to become someone that creates games instead of someone that only plays them as it is
    imposible in my country to make a career of it. I spent a lot of time thinking about what it was that I'd love to do as an adult and it was hard
    at the beggining but as I graduated from Highschool I had the opportunity to go to med school. I spent almost 6 semesters in med school before
    dropping out. At first I liked it and found it very interesting but as time passed, I felt that something within me was dying. It was very hard
    keeping up with that lifestyle and after seeing so much pain and death you start to see life differently. I felt that i had to do what I really
    wanted to do, even if it meant leaving my country.

    <p>My favorite videogame series are the Drakengard/Nier series created by Yokotaro.</p>
    <p style="color:red;">The stories in this universe are some of the best pieces of media that I have ever experienced and I could even say that it is the peak of what art is.</p>
